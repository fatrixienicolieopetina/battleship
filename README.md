### Entry to TOP's Battleship exercise under the full JS Curriculum

#### Learning Outcomes
1. TDD
2. Testing Basics
3. Unit Testing
4. Red-green cycle



#### ðŸ“Œ Notes
Three Modes of TDD
1. Obvious implementation. You write the test with the implementation since you know how to implement the method to test.
2. Fake it til you make it. If you know the problem and solutions, but the way you code them up is not immediately obvious to you, then you can use a trick called "fake it 'til you make it."
3. Triangulation . This is the most conservative way of doing TDD. If you don't even know the solution, you just get to green at all costs , red-green, red-green loop.
